Exercise 1.9 – Variable Names
The Python interpreter has strict rules for variable names. Which of the following are legal Python names? If the name is not legal, state the reason.
1. and
2. and
3. var
4. var1
5. 1var
6. my-name
7. your name
8. COLOR

Exercise 1.10 – Types
It is important that we know the type of the values stored in a variable so that we can use the correct operators (as we have already seen!). Python automatically infers the type from the value you assign to the variable. Write down the type of the values stored in each of the variables below. Pay special attention to punctuation: values are not always the type they seem!
1. a = False
2. b = 3.7
3. c = ’Alex’
4. d = 7
5. e = ’True’
6. f = 17
7. g = ’17’
8. h = True
9. i = ’3.14159’
To verify your answers, you can use the interactive Python shell, but first try to do the exercise without help.
>>> x = 100
>>> type(x)
<type ’int’>
>>>

Exercise 1.11 – Natural Language Processing
Consider the following sentence:
Alice saw the boy on the hill with the telescope.
1. Draw a sketch of what’s described in this sentence.
2. Draw a different sketch that could also be described by this sentence.
3. Write the sentence in two different ways, that clarifies the meaning of each of your sketches, next to your above sketches (hint: rewrite the sentence using extra words, commas, etc).
4. The ambiguity illustrated by this sentence is known as “prepositional phrase attachment.” Think about this as you continue to learn how to program, and consider how programming languages are designed to avoid the ambiguity illustrated by this example!
