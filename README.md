## Introduction to programming for Physics and Astronomy

This is the mini-course in programming for first year physics and astronomy
students at the University of Amsterdam. It is a fast paced course that is
designed to be given in 8 hours of hands-on practice a week.

Each first week contains a little bit of theory, small exercises and a few
larger exercises for more experienced students (hacker editions). The following
week has larger problems in the domain of mathematics and physics, that use all
of the concepts of previous weeks.

In this edition, the course also leans on students preparing through reading
chapters of the [Think Python book].
