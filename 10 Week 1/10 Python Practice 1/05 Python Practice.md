# The first day!

This *Python Practice* section will be your first day of Python programming. Today, you'll learn about communicating with the user, strings, loops and if statements.

Please prepare for this day using the readings below. They will not always immediately make sense without practice, but that's no problem. You may want to re-read them over the weekend.

## Readings

From [*How to think like a computer scientist* (Allen Downey)](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html).

* Before today: chapters 1 (all), 2 (all) & 4.12
* After today: chapters 4.1, 4.2, 4.4-4.7, 6.1 & 6.2.

## What to turn in

You are to hand in the answers to the exercises, three python source code files that we can test, and optionally one or two python files for the Hacker edition.

## Deadline

The deadline is today, by 18:00. However, you are required to review your exercises with an assistant before 16:30.
